      "As actresses took to their social media pages to express both shock and sadness over the untimely death of Sridevi , one common thread ran through all their posts. Almost all of them seem to have taken her as their inspiration to become an actress . From posts saying how dancing to Mere Haathon Mein Nau Nau Chudiyan Hai in school events to imitating scenes from Chaalbaaz and Mr India, she provided that inspiration for all of them to chart out their career in showbiz. All of them spoke about being girls who grew up in the 80s and 90s, looking at her larger than life persona on screen. Donning a chiffon sari and dancing atop the ice-capped mountains in Europe is something that any young showbiz aspirant has on her bucketlist. With many firsts in terms of trend and style to her credit, Sridevi has an irreplacable place in Indian cinema.\n",

Not only the beginning of the Laxmikant–Pyarelal song was elaborate and interesting, the way it was choreographed and picturised on Sridevi makes it one of the most memorable songs in Indian cinema. The manner in which she emoted the lyrics was astounding, and her expressions phenomenal. Onscreen she was a vivacious actor, well-known for her naughty and quirky mannerisms. But off the camera, Sridevi was a very gentle and shy person, not to forget the grace and beautiful smile. Following the success of, we had all travelled together to Siliguri for a concert. From Anil Kapoor to Amrish Puri, everyone was part of the troupe. I remember, the fan craze for Sridevi there was unbelievable. I have sang for her in a number of films includingand. The title track ofis another favourite. Her demise is a big loss for the industry. My condolences to Boney Kapoor and their daughters – Janhvi and Khushi.\n",

She was a combination of Amitabh Bachchan Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan . An excellent actor, a skilled dancer and style icon, Sridevi was a powerhouse of talent. Although my first film with her wasin Telugu, it was only in the Hindi moviethat I got to share more time and screen presence with her. During the making of the film, she even praised my dialogues in Hindi. She may, sometimes, had come across as slightly arrogant, but in reality she was quite a shy and naive person, who lacked confidence off screen and thus kept to herself at most times. She was an all-rounder; a class apart. It is a big loss for the entire film industry.\n",
